    <p>Hi! My name is Delfin Saygi. I am currently 19 years old and in the first year of the Global Bachelor of Business Administration program at ESSEC Business School. I am half Turkish, half Greek and have lived in both countries. I love to travel and experience new cultures. I have visited 17 countries across Europe and have been selected to move to ESSEC's Singapore campus in September! 

     Currently I am learning how to program a website and this is my first project. I am excited to share my work with you!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Tennis</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to sport, tennis holds a special place in my heart. I have been practising this sport since second grade and have played many tennis matches both in competitions and for fun. Some of my best memories were created on tennis courts, talking with friends, learning new techniques and enjoying the sheer thrill of the game. Tennis has taught me about perseverance, teamwork and cooperation. Through practising this sport, I have acquired many soft skills that are useful in my social and professional life in equal measure. I have improved upon my collaboration and communication skills in equal measure, working with team members to achieve a common goal: victory on the tennis field! Even though I have played both singles and doubles, I feel that playing a match with a second team member is more interactive! I feel a strong connection to this sport and hope to continue improving my tennis skills. I would like to join ESSEC's tennis team next year.

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Travelling</h2>
    <p> 
        Exploring the beautiful landscapes, cities and cultures the world has to offer is when I feel most alive. I am fortunate enough to have visited 17 countries so far and hope one day to have seen them all. Every journey is an adventure tht allows me to step out of my comfort zone, challenging me to embrace the unfamiliar and discover new aspects of myself. Traveling teaches me to appreciate the present moment and beauty of the sighta before me. It is a way of forming new memories with my loved ones and sharing moments that transcend language and cultural barriers. One of the favourite countries I have visited is Iceland. With its volcanoes, waterfalls, glaciers and mountains, the landscape is unique and competely different than my hometown Athens. This summer I hope to visit the South of Italy and discover new landscapes in my home country, Greece. I look forwards to organising new travels!

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Reading</h2>
    <p>
        Ever since I was a child, I have loved to read. Reading books allow me to explore worlds beyond my imagination, where adventures unfold and characters become as real as the people in my life. Having won the reading competition of my junior school aged 10, I would say I am an avid reader.This hobby sharpens my mind, enriches my vocabulary, and deepens my understanding of the human experience. If I had to make an estimate I would say I currently read about 10 books a year, ranging in a variety of genres and topics from lighter subjects to traditional classics. One of my favourite authors is Jane Austen. I have read Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.
